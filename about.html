                I have several projects listed above that I am extremely passionate about. The Pitch Data Dashboard is one of 
                the few things I have finished as a complete product. I used a Python framework called Panel that makes it easier 
                to programatically create interactive dashboards for users to view datasets. I used Panel to make visualizations 
                to better understand an extremely dense dataset with 100,000+ pitches. I created a velocity vs spin-rate scatter 
                plot with the ability to change the pitcher and pitch types, a heat map to analyze pitch sequencing, and a line 
                chart to analyze temporal pitch tendencies.

                Another project of mine in my MLB Lineup Optimizer. This was an extension of an assignment from DS3500, Advanced Programming with Data. 
                In the assignment we created an avolutionary computing framework that allowed us to optimize TA scheduling withing a college.
                This framework require the creation of objective functions based on certain penalties that the solution violated, and agent functions 
                that made a small change to the solution. The framework complete this process until the most optimal solution is created with the lowest penalty score.
                I observed the list-like structure of the solution and the one-to-one changes that the agents made and realized how similar this was to a baseball lineup.
                So I altered the solution, the functions, and the framework to change the scope to optimize an MLB Lineup.
