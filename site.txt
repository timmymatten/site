The style.css fyle contains several styling changes

First, I change the font of the body along with the margin, text color, and backgriound color.

Next, the navigation portion handle the links to each of the different pages. 
This allows the buttons to be a different color than the rest of the text and to be underlined only when hovering

Next, the headings are a different color, bolded, and a different size than the body.

The images are edited to be an appropriate size and to have rounded corners for aesthetic

Finally, I change the footer margins to look nice and change the list and p text to have double line spacing.
