                Hello and welcome! My name is Tim, and this website is a small glimpse into who I am and what I enjoy.
                Iâ€™m currently a student who loves exploring topics in technology, data, and sports. 
                Something I am extremely excited about is that I recently accepted my first co-op position at 
                WHOOP as a Marketing Analytics Co-op
